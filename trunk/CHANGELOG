UNSTABLE
---------------------------------------
- support for new Trimaran 3.7 
- post_install.sh script for easier workspace setup
- moved common routines to common.cpp
- cleaner class interfaces
- wait_key() after each error condition
- support for Fuzzy Genetic approach


20050512
---------------------------------------
- PD_kernel.c: rewritten L1I cache reference code to avoid unlimited
  growing of memory usage during simulation
- PD_dinero.c: bus transitions are now computed here. No more huge
  cache reference files and computational overhead. 
- GA: user can now choose how often to write out a pareto report
- added overall regalloc overhead report in detail estimation file
- separate SUBSPACES directory into trimaran-workspace/epic-explorer
- updated installing instructions
- estimator.cpp: changed unsigned long -> unsigned long long in estimator sources
- explorer.cpp: removed prefixed explorations functions (e.g.
  test_explore_L1D()). The code has been moved to test() function to
  create some example of Explorer class usage.
- Reorganized README file

20050207
---------------------------------------
- cleaner .est files, fixed IPC (ops/cyles) report
- fixed a bug that did not allow to start a new exploration when 
  the only difference from the previous was the value of H formation option
- exit with error when trying to set an invalid value to a
  configuration space parameter (prints debug info and doesn't prompt
  anymore to manually set valid value)
- changed some data variables from int to unsigned long to avoid
  overflow with long running benchmarks

20042212
---------------------------------------
- suppport for saving a file with details of each
  configuration estimate
- Fixed get_pareto() and save_simulations() bug when using energy instead of power
- more explicit output file names
- implemented more realistic L1 inst cache references in PD_kernel.c
  Trimaran code
- base directory changed to $HOME/trimaran-workspace/epic-explorer
- created compile.sh script to compile everything in epic dir
- renamed 'Interface_user_demo' class and files to 'User_interface'

20040616
---------------------------------------
- added support for enabling/disabling hyperblock formation
- added support for enabling/disabling autoclock frequency
- solved edit space interface bug
- restored original compilation flag for epic makefile
- MOGA : usage of standard <sstream> headers

20031205
---------------------------------------
- Added support for GA 3d exploration
- Removed get_feasible_space() memory overflow
- Changed compilation flags to optimize speed (-O2)

20031120
---------------------------------------
- Automatic clock frequency optimization
- Simulated spaces saving improved and added to options
- Totally rewritten bus transition counter
- Separated subspace and user settings files
- Added save Trimaran PD_STATS option
- Reorganized menu interface

20030911
---------------------------------------
- Optimized GA exploration to avoid unnecessary recompilations
- Saved simulations must show even the values of fixed params
- PBSA support for 3d exploration
- fixed NO_L2_SIZE_CHECK bug in second phase of PBSA
- fixed build_cross_merge(...) feasible config bug


20030905
---------------------------------------
- bug in L2 dynamic stats : L2 write miss was always 0.

20030716
---------------------------------------
- rewritten address bus transition counter, much faster
- more readable dynamic stats output
- rescaled power densities from 2Ghz to 500Mhz clock
- updated installation instructions

20030620
---------------------------------------
- Scaled cache power model tech from 0.8um to 0.1um, to be more
  consistent with the processor power model
- Area models are now all to 0.35um
- Clock frequency set to 500Mhz

20030508
---------------------------------------
- Added GA exploration
- Added DEPMOD exploration
- Added RANDOM
- Added exploration Scheduler
- Added support for multi-function benchmarks
- Added jpeg benchmark package
- Added the possibility to choose between Power and Energy
- Added exploration space editor
- Added multiple exploration space saving
- Fixed build_cross_merge bug : it did not discarded not feasible
  configurations
- Optimized simulate_space() to avoid repeat exploration over the
  same space
