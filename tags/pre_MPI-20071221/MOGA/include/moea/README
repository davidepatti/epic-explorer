moealib is a C++ library for multi-objective evolutionary algorithms.
currently included moeas are:
	Niched Pareto Genetic Algorithm
	Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm
	Pareto Tree Searching Genetic Algorithm
	Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm
	Vector Evaluated Genetic Algorithm

This library is mainly research-oriented rather than application oriented.
It is designed together with my research work on MOEA, and actually one 
result of my work is a new algorithm, Pareto Tree Searching Genetic Algorithm,
which is also included in the library.

No separate and detailed documents are available now (maybe I will do it later.),
though there are comments in each head or source file.

Parameters to the moea can be set either by member functions or command line arguments.
'a.out --help' will give a detailed explanation for the way to enter command line arguments.

See examples in knapsack/ about how a meoa program should be written.

makefiles for moealib and for example programs in knapsack/ are also provided.
assert() is used frequently in all my source codes, and it aims both at debugging
and at commenting. Accordingly, there are two versions both for moealib and for example 
programs, one optimized version(disabling assert()), the other debugging version.
Please see each makefile for details.

I did all the work under linux, using emacs and g++ complier(thanks to the authors).

Below is a list of all the head files in moealib.

AlleleStr.h        allele string class. 
Assign.h           class for fitness assign. Beware not all meoas use an explicit assign class. 
Bin2DecGenome.h    float representation class 'is-a' IND class and 'has-a' mapping object.
Genome.h           IND class 'is-a' AlleleStr (genome information) and 'has-a' ObjectiveVector.
Grid_Loc.h         binary string encoded location for grid(node) in Pareto Tree Searching GA.
MOEA.h             base class for multi-objective evolutionary algorithms.
NPGA.h             Niched Pareto GA.
NSGA.h             Nondominated Sorting GA
Normalizer.h       Vector class 'has-a' object of this class to do metric normalization.
ObjectiveVector.h  add static member mM to Vector class to indicate minimize or maximize.
PTSGA.h            Pareto Tree Searching GA.
PTree.h            Pareto Tree class. similar to population in other moeas.
PTreeNode.h        node class for Pareto Tree.
ParameterList.h    MOEA 'has-a' object of this class to (mainly) do command line parsing.
Pareto.h           The base class for nearly all classes here. Defining static members(mM, etc.)
Population.h       container class for individuals
Random.h           random generator defined as macro. copied from genesis.
Reduction.h        class doing population reduction. Only used by SPEA.
SPEA.h             Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm.
Select.h           selection class
VEGA.h             Vector Evaluated GA
Vector.h           class template for vector.
