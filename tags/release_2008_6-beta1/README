***************************************************************
	SECTION I. REQUIREMENTS
***************************************************************

This version of epic explorer will work on Trimaran version 4.0 

If you need to use older versions of trimaran please download a
previous versione of epic explorer (i.e.  20060312-r2 version works
with trimaran 3.7)

NOTE: if compiling for AMD64 architectures (e.g. Opteron) with a 64
bit distribution, see also the specific notes at the appendix of this
document.


***************************************************************
	SECTION II. INSTALLING TRIMARAN 
***************************************************************

First of all, you have to install the Trimaran compiler framework.

                     *** IMPORTANT! ****

Before reporting a bug see section V "COMMON PROBLEMS
AND ERRORS" at the end of this document.

Please follow carefully these steps:

1) Download Trimaran 4.0 from http://www.trimaran.org/download.shtml

2) Unpack the trimaran archive. A good choice is usually to put it your
home directory. We will refer to the chosen dir as <TRDIR>

3) Download epic explorer source from http://epic-explorer.sourceforge.net/

4) Unpack epic explorer source. Even in this case, a good choice is
usually to put it your home directory. We will refer to the chosen dir
as <EPICDIR>

5) Copy the file 'PD_m5e.c' from <EPICDIR>/MISC_FILES/ to
<TRDIR>/simu/src/emulib/

If both epic and trimaran sources have been unpacked inside your home
directory, the following command will probably work:

cp -f ~/epic/MISC_FILES/PD_m5e.c ~/trimaran/simu/src/emulib/

6) Now you can proceed with the normal trimaran installation. 
Follow the istructions of section 'Manual Installation' of the pdf
manual found in the trimaran/manual directory.

    NOTE 6.1: you should start from step 4 of  subsection 2.2, in other
    words, you should NOT unpack *again* the source, because this would
    overwrite the new PD_m5e.c copied in the previous step 5)

    NOTE 6.2: As regards step 4 of subsection 2.2, if you are using a
    GNU/Linux based system and you unpacked sources in the home
    directory, you probably should not modify the envrc.bash script.
    In any case, a good choice to avoid problems in the future is to
    add the 'source...' command to the .bashrc, as suggested in the
    same section of the manual.

7) If the above step was ok, install M5 memory simulator as
explained in Section 7 of trimaran manual. 

NOTE: you will probably encounter the errors E.2 described in
Section V of this README.

NOTE: if compiling for AMD64 architectures (e.g. Opteron) with a 64
bit distribution, see also the specific notes at the appendix of this
document.

***************************************************************
	SECTION III. INSTALLING EPIC EXPLORER 
***************************************************************

NOTE: 
If upgrading from a previous Epic Explorer version for trimaran 3.x,
delete all the files in 'trimaran-workspace/epic-explorer/' since they
might be incompatible with the new version and cause segfaults.

In any case, removing or renaming the whole previous trimaran-workspace
directory is a safe choice, since the new 'post_install.sh' script
creates everything needed.

1) If not yet done, unpack epic explorer source (probably in your home
directory)

2) Enter the 'epic' source directory

3) Just type 'make' to compile the source 

4) If compilation completed successifully, type:

"./post_install.sh" 

from epic source dir. 

This should check if everything is ok and create all the necessary
files in trimaran-workspace directory. 

Now you should be able to run Epic Explorer executable from
its source dir simply by typing "./epic".

If all seems ok, skip to next Section IV

NOTE: 
If you are *NOT* using an x86 GNU/Linux based system you should edit
environment.h to specify the compiler and the platform, using the same
values as trimaran/scripts/envrc
  

***************************************************************
	SECTION IV. USING EPIC EXPLORER
***************************************************************

- start Epic explorer by typing ./epic from source dir

Now, you can use epic in two ways:

(1) USING AN EXPLORATION ALGORITHM:

- Optionally choose preferred setting from 'main' menu. 

- Optionally choose a space or edit a new one from 'design space' menu.

- Choose an design space exploration algorithm from the 'space
  exploration' menu. 
  (You can also choose 'x' to sequentially schedule different algorithm
  on the same space.)

- After each exploration has ended, resulting files are created into
  trimaran-workspace/epic-explorer/<name_of_benchmark> directory.

(2) PERFORM STEPS MANUALLY

- The 'manual test' menu' shows the steps required for evaluating each
  single system configuration. The configuration, along with results
  of the compilation/execution are created in:
  trimaran-workspace/epic-explorer/step_by_step directory.


OUTPUT FILE NAMES 
  ------------------------
  - *.exp : exploration files. They contain the values of the estimated
    objectives and the configurations explored. 
    
    The filename format is:

    bench_ALGO_space.exp: set of estimated configurations using
    design space exploration algorithm 'ALGO' on subspace 'space'
    running benchmark 'bench'. 

    bench_ALGO_space.pareto.exp: same as above, but this file
    contains only configurations belonging to the pareto set (e.g.
    non-dominated configuration representing all possible trade-offs).

    NOTE: For some algorithms you will get multiple .pareto.exp files,
    each numbered according to the phase when the pareto set was
    computed (e.g. number of generations in GA).

  - *.stat: statistical files, whose contents depend on the algorithm used.

  - *.est: each of this files contains the estimation details of each
    single configuration encountered during exploration. Since the
    number of these files may be very large, this option is disabled
    by default.

  - PD_STATS_n: this is the raw n-th PD_STATS file generated by
    Trimaran. Disabled by default, only for epic debug purpose. To see
    estimation details used by Epic Explorer better use *.est files.


***************************************************************
	SECTION V. COMMON PROBLEMS AND ERRORS
***************************************************************
This section lists common errors you can experience while trying to
compile trimaran or epic explorer.

    OK, I HAVE A PROBLEM, CAN I ASK YOU ?

IMPORTANT: in order to avoid confusion it's essential that distinguish
between the problems of trimaran and those of epic explorer.

In other words: don't mail to trimaran developers if you have problems
while compiling/using epic explorer. On the other hand, don't bother
me with problems that are strictly related to compiling trimaran.

  Please report gcc version, GNU/Linux distribution and any other
  useful info.


COMMONLY REPORTED ERRORS (and suggested solutions)

***  ERROR.1.a ********************************************
Missing 'aclocal'

>>> SOLUTION:
Install automake!!

***  ERROR.1.b ********************************************

When finishing the compilation of openimpact, the following error is
encountered:
----------------------------------------------------------------
"platform/x86lin_gcc/IPA_lib/__impact_lib.c", line 3244: error: 
declaration is incompatible with "const char *poptStrerror(const int)" 
(declared at line 463 of "/usr/include/popt.h")
  const char * const poptStrerror(const int error)

>>> SOLUTION: 

change the declaration of poptStrerror in the file:
platform/x86lin_gcc/IPA_lib/__impact_lib.c

the correct declaration is : 
  const char * poptStrerror(const int error)


***  ERROR.2.a ****************************************

While trying to compile M5 cache simulator,  the following error is
encountered:
----------------------------------------------------------------
ALPHA/arch/alpha/decoder.cc:5619: error: definition of 
‘StaticInstPtr<AlphaISA> AlphaISA::decodeInst(uint32_t)’ is not in 
namespace enclosing ‘AlphaISA’
scons: *** [ALPHA/arch/alpha/decoder.os] Error 1
scons: building terminated because of errors.
make: *** [install/m5/build/ALPHA/libm5shared.so] Error 2

>>> SOLUTION: 

Switch to gcc 3.4 just to compile m5. Then you can continue
compiling emulib files with gcc 4 without any problem.

***  ERROR.2.b ****************************************

While trying to compile M5 cache simulator,  the following error is
encountered:

/usr/bin/ld: libelf/lib/libelf.a(begin.o): relocation R_X86_64_32
against `a local symbol' can not be used when making a shared object;
rec ompile with -fPIC libelf/lib/libelf.a: could not read symbols: Bad
value

>>> SOLUTION:

You are probably using an AMD64 architecture.  In this case libelf.a is not
properly linked and so libm5shared.so is NOT created.

The problem is that the M5 used in trimaran is an old version that
has some problems (see also E.2.a)
I'm searching for old messages in http://osdir.com/ml/emulators.m5.users/ for a
solution.

In the meanwhile, you can try to compile trimaran and m5 in a
different machine and then copy the file:

trimaran/m5/install/m5/build/m5/build/ALPHA/libm5shared.so 

to the not-working machine. In my case it did work!


***  E.3 **********************************************

When compiling/executing a benchmark, the following error is
encountered:
----------------------------------------------------------------
Linking Pcode
ls: [^_]*.pst: No such file or directory
ls: _*.pst: No such file or directory
Plink  -e pstl
Pcode error: main() not defined
Exiting: non-zero exit code
Exiting: non-zero exit code
tcc: Error: compile_bench -nosync -p ~/trimaran/openimpact/parms/STD_PARMS.IMPACT unsuccessful, bailing out! 

>>> SOLUTION:

You should edit the file ~/trimaran/openimpact/scripts/gen_CtoP and
apply these changes:

- Modify the first line from #!/bin/sh to #!/bin/bash;
- At line 556 there are two lines containing the words: "for F in ....":
  delete both lines and replace them with a single line: 
        for F in `\ls *.pst` ; do FPST="$FPST $F"; done;


*******************************************************
AMD64 - SPECIFIC
*******************************************************
In order to compile trimaran M5 cache simulator on AMD64 bit machines
with a 64 bit linux distribution some tweaks were required, since all
the code needs to be compiled in 32 bit mode.

1) Install multilib and ia32libs. On ubuntu linux the packages name
are 'multilib' and 'ia32libs'. 

NOTE: For unknown reasons, on my ubuntu linux the installation of
these packages did not add the required lines on
ld.so.conf, so the linker was not able to find the 32 bit version of
the libraries. Referring to the 64bit Ubuntu, I had to create a file:

/etc/ld.so.conf.d/x86_32-linux-gnu

containing a single row that specifies the added path:

/usr/lib32


2) gcc4.1 DOES NOT work (gives some namespace related errors)

---> Install 3.4 version of gcc and g++

It's HIGHLY recommended to create two wrapper scripts, named
respectively 'gcc' and 'g++', each containing these two lines:

#!/bin/bash
gcc-3.4 -m32 $*

(obviously change gcc to g++ in the script named 'g++')
Now you can put these two scripts in a certain directory, for example
'my_wrappers' in your home. To be sure to execute them
instead of the usual /usr/bin/gcc you should, just for the M5
compilation, put this path before the standard path, for example:

export PATH=/home/YOURUSER/my_wrappers:$PATH

Remember: this is needed just for the M5 compilation, to be sure that
the 3.4 version of compiler is invoked with the argument -m32.

3) If you get:

/usr/bin/ld: libelf/lib/libelf.a(begin.o): relocation R_X86_64_32
against `a local symbol' can not be used when making a shared object;
recompile with -fPIC

you should add -fPIC to the gcc command in the file:
trimaran/m5/install/m5/build/libelf/lib/Makefile

and launch again the make command inside the
'trimaran/m5/install/m5/build/libelf/lib/' directory.

and then relaunch the 'ldconfig' command to regenerate the cache of
library paths.
