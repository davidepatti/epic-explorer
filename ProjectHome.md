EPIC Explorer is a open framework for evaluation, in terms of performance, cost and power consumption, of a system based on a parameterized VLIW microprocessor together with the memory hierarchy subsystem following execution of a specific application. It interfaces to the parameterized Trimaran infrastructure that provide powerful compiler and simulation tools for a large class of EPIC/VLIW architectures. Further, EPIC Explorer implements a number of multi-objective DSE algorithms to obtain Pareto-optimal configurations and a set of C++ classes that facilitate the creation of new DSE strategies.
